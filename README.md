Settings notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Remove type from CSS and JavaScript resources**. **DEPRECATED**. Not needed for themes that have *script* and *style* (available since November 2019 and WordPress 5.3) in the HTML5 features they support. See: <https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/10/15/miscellaneous-developer-focused-changes-in-5-3/>

**Remove query string from static resources**. **TENTATIVE**. A popular WordPress tweak but I have not seen real-world benefits from using it.
